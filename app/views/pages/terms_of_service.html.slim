      ## 1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service

      Welcome to Knight.io! (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We are excited to have you as user an member of the community.

The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy, that you can review here: http://www.knight.io/privacy

      We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Knight.io, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.

      Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at sayhi@knight.io.

      ## 3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy

You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Knight in person.
